# Worker template 
This is an Arcite worker template. 

One needs to add the code that should be executed with 
the parameters for the execution. 

The worker will register itself to the cluster and the offered features
will become available in the web transform interface.

The /dcos folder contains an example of a json config file for DCOS.
The only value that needs to be changed is the name of cluster to which
the worker should register.
